# Shadow Length Calculator

Recently, I had to plan when I would do a series of weeklong missions for an extensive mapping project my company is contracted to complete. Based on my project requirements, I wrote a script that would return all times of the year when the sun was high enough, using shadow length ratio as my primary metric. I've converted this script into a web app in hopes that it might help some of you with your mission planning.

I've copied an example output below, but please visit the link to enter your parameters. If you have any feedback or improvement ideas, I would love to hear them.
