### Hello!

My name is Kyle. I'm curious about many things, but primarily I try to find ways to use tech in biology. Cameras are my favorite data collection tool, particularly when attached to drones. 

I work as an environmental consultant for [Althouse and Meade, Inc.](https://www.althouseandmeade.com/) in Paso Robles, CA.
